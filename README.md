## Step 1: 
>Business concept:
I will be targeting Kigali Public Library making them a database to monitor the in and out of books.

>Data Challenge:
The library currently struggles to monitor which books are borrowed most frequently, how long they stay checked out, and which users contribute most to circulation. Without structured tracking, it is difficult to identify borrowing patterns, popular categories, or potential issues with overdue books.

>Expected Outcome:
By analyzing circulation transactions with PL/SQL window functions, the library will:
.Identify the top borrowed books and categories per quarter.
.Track borrowing frequency trends over time (running totals, moving averages).
.Measure growth or decline in borrowings month-to-month.
.Segment library members into groups (e.g., heavy users vs casual readers).
.Provide actionable insights to improve book purchasing, stock management, and member engagement.
